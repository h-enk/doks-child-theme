Here are some misc notes from the production of this site:

Full demo: https://getdoks.org/


- Adding the showcase to the default template:

#########
Showcase comment from Github: https://github.com/h-enk/doks/discussions/557

Layout in github: https://github.com/h-enk/getdoks.org/tree/master/layouts/showcase
Content section in github: https://github.com/h-enk/getdoks.org/tree/master/content/showcase
#########


- Initial thought on structure:
    * R section 
    * SQL section 
    * Python (eventually)
    * Other Languages and Resources
        * This section will have small sections for individual things, such as JSON, Github, markdown, etc.
    * Showcase (portfolio)
    * Blog (eventually write stuff?)
